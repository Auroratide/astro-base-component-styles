# Astro Base Component Styles

This repo showcases a potential bug in [Astro](https://astro.build).

See **[the deployed site](https://auroratide.github.io/astro-base-component-styles/)**. Even though this is just the base project, the stylesheet does not seem to be loaded.

This is because despite defining `base` in the config, the following link is always generated by Astro:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/asset.2cb5588a.css">
```

It should be:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/MY_BASE/assets/asset.2cb5588a.css">
```
